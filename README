= SCSU Information Finder

Website prototype constructed using Webby for SCSU's CSC 334 Human Computer Interactions Course

== Usage

Webby seems to be broken in 1.9.1, so give 1.8.7 a try. Worked for me :)

Install the webby gem:

  gem install webby

Then build the site:

  webby build

OR

  webby autobuild
